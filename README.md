# ISE535_Project
This Project is about predicting the quality of wine based on certain parameters.
A machine learning model is built and trained based on a portion of 2 datasets combined

#Random Forest Classifier #Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier #Support Vector Classifier

Then I tried to increase the accuracy of the models

These datasets are public available for research purposes only. The details are described in [Cortez et al., 2009]: [Â©Elsevier] [Pre-press (pdf)] [bib]. 
Please include this citation if you plan to use these datasets:
P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. 
In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.

The data can be used to test (ordinal) regression or classification (in effect, this is a multi-class task, where the clases are ordered) methods. 
Other research issues are feature selection and outlier detection. The data includes two datasets:

winequality-red.csv - red wine preference samples;
winequality-white.csv - white wine preference samples
